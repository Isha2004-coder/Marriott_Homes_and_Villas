# Market, Users, Prototype

## Understand Your Market
*Provide links to the 3 websites you explored* 
https://www.airbnb.com/ ,
https://www.vrbo.com/ ,
https://www.wander.com/



*Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison* 

The websites I chose offer whole-home rentals, targing people who are looking
for temporary stay in a private accomodation. These are strong competitors within the industry and have similar target users. Airbnb and VRBO are well-established in the market, while Wander gives a different perspective.
    
*List at least 10 product features*
1) user can filter by selecting a price range
2) user can search specfic type of property like cabin, apartment etc.
3) user can see map view of the rental
3) users can see testimonials and reviews of the property
4) users can choose the number of travellers
5) users can search by location and date
6) users can use sorting option (recomended, most popular etc.)
7) users can see the host name and message them once booked
8) users can see amentities avaiable in a property
9) user can share and save a listing
10) users can report a listing if it is a scam
   

## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

The user research suggests that the users have navigation issues, particularly in finding places they are not familiar with. Both qualitative and quantitative feedback point out that users struggle with a cluttered map with too many pinned sites, which confuse them about where they plan to go. They also struggle with property-centric filters rather than focusing on destination-based experiences like activities and attractions. The research indicates that users desire a more streamlined, intuitive browsing experience, with clear, easy-to-use filters and an emphasis on destinations over property features.
